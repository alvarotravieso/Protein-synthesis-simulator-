# üß¨ Protein Synthesis Simulator ‚Äî Python Edition

Welcome to the Protein Synthesis Simulator: a tiny, playful Python project that models the central dogma of molecular biology ‚Äî from DNA to mRNA to protein. It's perfect for demos, teaching, or just geeking out about codons and amino acids. üöÄ

## What it does

- Generates random DNA sequences (with a start codon and a stop codon). üß©
- Transcribes DNA ‚Üí mRNA by replacing T with U. ‚úçÔ∏è
- Translates mRNA ‚Üí protein using a simple ribosome model and a codon table. üî¨

## Project structure

- `DNA_Generator.py` ‚Äî builds random DNA sequences (uses NumPy).
- `ADN.py` ‚Äî `ADN` class: stores DNA and computes the complementary strand.
- `ARN.py` ‚Äî `ARN` class: creates mRNA from an `ADN` instance.
- `Ribosoma.py` ‚Äî `Ribosoma` class: translates mRNA codons into amino acids.
- `Main.py` ‚Äî example runner that wires everything together and prints results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy (used by `DNA_Generator.py`)

Quick install:

```bash
python -m pip install --user numpy
```

Optionally create a virtual environment first:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install numpy
```

## How to run

Run the main script to generate and translate several DNA sequences:

```bash
python Main.py
```

Note: The repository contains `Main.py` (capital M). If you prefer `main.py`, rename the file or update the README accordingly.

## Example output

You should see blocks like:

- ADN: ATG...TAA
- ARNm: AUG...UAA
- Protein: ['Met', 'Ala', 'Stop']

(Proteins are shown as a list of 3-letter amino acid codes until a stop codon is encountered.)

## Ideas & enhancements (pull requests welcome!) ‚ú®

- Add a `requirements.txt` and a small CLI to control how many sequences to generate.
- Add unit tests (pytest) covering transcription and translation.
- Improve sequence validation (handle incomplete codons, ambiguous bases, etc.).
- Add visualization: colorized codon breakdown, peptide length histograms, etc.
